# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.  The following deliverables are required.
  - Preprocessing the Data for PCA
  - Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
  - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
  - Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
